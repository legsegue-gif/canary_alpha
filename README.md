## 💡 Overview

Canary is a cross-platform LLM client built with Flutter for Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and Linux. Connect your own API keys or sign in with a supported subscription, and switch between OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, OpenRouter and any OpenAI-compatible service without switching apps.

Canary goes beyond chat. Models can search the web, call MCP servers, follow skills and remember what matters to you. Bind a conversation to a **workspace** and the model can read and edit files and run commands: inside a Linux sandbox on your phone, or in a native shell on your computer.

Conversations, settings and files are stored locally. Canary has no account system of its own; back up to WebDAV or S3-compatible storage whenever you choose.

## 🧭 Getting Started

1. **Add a model provider.** Open **Settings → Providers**, enter an API key for a preset provider or add your own endpoint, then fetch its model list. To use a ChatGPT, Grok or Kimi Code account instead, sign in from the **Accounts** tab under **Add Provider**.
2. **Start a conversation.** Select a model from the input bar. Turn on web search, MCP servers, tools or reasoning for the current chat from the same bar.
3. **Let the model work with files (optional).** Open **Settings → Workspace & environment** and create a workspace, then bind it to a conversation from the chat. On Android and iOS, install the Linux environment on the same page first; the iOS environment is bundled with the app, so nothing is downloaded.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Models and Providers

- **Native protocols**: OpenAI Chat Completions and Responses API, Google Gemini and Vertex AI, and Anthropic Claude, plus any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, including self-hosted models.
- **Built-in presets** for OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, SiliconFlow, Alibaba Cloud, Zhipu AI, xAI, ByteDance and more.
- **Account sign-in**: use a ChatGPT (Codex), Grok or Kimi Code account directly. Canary syncs the available models and shows your usage limits.
- **Model capabilities**: set input and output modalities, tool use and reasoning per model. Choose a reasoning level from off to maximum, or set a custom token budget.
- **Provider-side tools**, where supported: native web search, URL context, code execution, code interpreter and image generation.
- **Multiple API keys** per provider, with round-robin, priority, least-used or random load balancing and automatic error tracking.
- **Request control**: custom headers and request body at the provider, model or assistant level; HTTP, HTTPS or SOCKS5 proxy per provider; Claude prompt caching; balance lookup; automatic retry with exponential backoff.
- **Organization and sharing**: group providers, and share or import provider configurations as a QR code or text.

### 🤖 Agent and Workspaces

- **Workspaces**: bind a conversation to a workspace to give the model seven tools: `shell`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `list_dir`, `glob` and `grep`. Command output streams live, file edits appear as diffs, and shell commands can require approval, which you grant per command or for the whole session.
- **A Linux sandbox on your phone**: Android runs Ubuntu, Debian or Alpine Linux through PRoot, or a rootfs image you import. iOS includes Alpine Linux based on iSH, so nothing needs to be downloaded. Install Python, Node.js, Git, SSH and other common tools from the app, and choose the fastest apt/apk, pip and npm mirrors after a speed test.
- **Native on desktop**: on macOS, Windows and Linux, tools run in your system shell, in an app-managed folder or a folder you link from your computer.
- **Files and terminal**: browse workspace files with previews for Markdown, HTML, CSV, images and text. Mobile has an in-app terminal; on desktop, open the workspace in your system terminal. On mobile, you can also mount up to 10 external folders into the sandbox, read-only or read-write.
- **Environment variables** shared by all workspaces, with controls that keep their values out of command output.
- **Skills**: import skills (a folder with a `SKILL.md`) from pasted Markdown, a `.md` or `.zip` file, or a GitHub URL. Enable them per assistant or per conversation. The bundled *skill-creator* skill helps the model write new ones.
- **MCP**: connect Model Context Protocol servers over Streamable HTTP, SSE or STDIO, with OAuth sign-in, JSON import, per-tool approval and a built-in fetch server. STDIO servers run natively on desktop and inside the Linux sandbox on mobile.
- **Ask user**: the model can pause to ask you multiple-choice or open questions, then continue with your answers.
- **Device tools**: time, clipboard, calculator and text-to-speech on every platform; calendar and location on Android and iOS; screen time on Android; weather, reminders and Apple Health data on iOS.
- **Scheduled tasks**: run a prompt with a chosen assistant on a schedule, such as a morning briefing. Results are saved as conversations. Available on Android and desktop.

### 🧩 Assistants, Memory and Context

- **Assistants**: each assistant has its own model, system prompt with template variables, preset messages, sampling parameters, context limit, custom request, tools, MCP servers, skills, default workspace, quick phrases, regex replacement rules, avatar and chat background. Organize assistants with tags.
- **Long-term memory**: with auto-organize turned on, a background pipeline decides after each conversation what is worth remembering, then extracts, deduplicates and merges it into four types: identity, workflow, voice and instructions. Memories can be global or limited to one assistant. You can browse, edit and archive every memory, maintain a structured user profile, and inspect each background run step by step. Injected memories stay stable so prompt caching keeps working.
- **World books**: entries triggered by keywords or regular expressions, injected at a configurable position, role and depth.
- **Instruction injection**: reusable prompt cards, such as the built-in Learning Mode, applied before you send a message.
- **Conversation tools**: context compression into a new chat, branches, response versions, temporary chats that are never saved, follow-up suggestions, and a per-chat model and system prompt. The descriptions of built-in tools can also be edited.

### 🔍 Search, Voice and Vision

- **Web search** with 24 services: Bing, DuckDuckGo, SearXNG, Brave, Exa, Tavily, Jina, Perplexity, Serper, Firecrawl, You.com, LinkUp, Parallel, Querit, TinyFish, AnySearch, Grok, Ollama, Bocha, Metaso, Zhipu, Doubao, StepFun and Canary. Multiple API keys are rotated automatically, and answers show their cited sources.
- **Text-to-speech**: the system voice, or OpenAI, Gemini, Azure, ElevenLabs, MiniMax, Qwen, Groq, xAI, MiMo, StepFun and Fish Audio.
- **Speech recognition**: the system recognizer, offline on-device models, or cloud services from OpenAI (Realtime), DashScope, Volcengine, MiMo and StepFun.
- **Multimodal input**: images, PDF and Word documents, text and code files, and audio for models that accept it. OCR with a dedicated vision model, and configurable image compression.
- **Image generation** with image-output models and provider tools, and an image mode in the input bar.
- **Translation**: translate a message in place, or use the dedicated translation page.

### 📝 Reading and Organizing

- **Rendering**: Markdown, syntax-highlighted code, LaTeX math, tables, Mermaid diagrams with PNG export, and HTML preview.
- **Export**: save a message or a selection as Markdown, plain text or a rendered image.
- **Navigation**: a minimap for long conversations, search across all conversations, pinning, and moving conversations between assistants.
- **Statistics**: an activity heatmap, token usage (input, output and cached), and rankings by model and assistant.

### 🎨 Appearance

- Light and dark mode, Android 12+ dynamic color, built-in palettes, and custom themes that can be shared as JSON.
- Chat wallpapers and gradient backgrounds. Message bubbles can use the theme default, frosted glass or a solid fill, with adjustable colors, borders, corner radius and blur.
- System fonts, imported font files, or Google Fonts downloaded on demand, set separately for the interface and for code.
- Interface in English, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese.

### 🔒 Data and Privacy

- **Local storage**: conversations, settings and attachments stay on your device.
- **Backup and restore**: WebDAV, S3-compatible storage, or a local file. Restore by overwriting or merging.
- **Local copies**: automatic on-device snapshots with weekly and monthly retention. A copy is always saved before a restore.
- **Import** from Cherry Studio and Chatbox.
- **Diagnostics**: request logs, context logs that show exactly what was sent to the model, and a storage usage breakdown.

### 🔗 System Integration

- **Mobile**: generation continues in the background with completion notifications, Live Activities on iOS, and Live Updates or a floating status capsule on Android. Share text and files to Canary from other apps, or send selected text to it from the Android text selection menu.
- **Desktop**: a multi-pane layout, customizable keyboard shortcuts including a global shortcut to show or hide Canary, system tray, drag-and-drop attachments, and window size and position restored between launches.

## 📊 Platform Differences

Most features work on every platform. These depend on the operating system:

| Capability | Android | iOS | macOS / Windows / Linux |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Workspace runtime | Linux sandbox (PRoot) | Linux sandbox (iSH) | Native shell |
| Linux distributions | Ubuntu, Debian, Alpine or imported rootfs | Alpine (included) | — |
| Terminal | In-app | In-app | System terminal |
| Access to outside folders | Up to 10 mounted folders | Up to 10 mounted folders | Link any local folder |
| MCP over STDIO | In sandbox | In sandbox | Native |
| Scheduled tasks | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| Background generation | Notification, Live Updates, floating capsule | Extra background time, Live Activities | While Canary is running |
| Platform-specific device tools | Calendar, location, screen time | Calendar, location, weather, reminders, Health | — |
| Global shortcut and system tray | — | — | ✓ |

On desktop, workspace commands run with your user account's permissions and are not sandboxed. Keep command approval turned on for workspaces that contain important files.

## 🔧 Building from Source

**Requirements**

- Flutter 3.44.9 or later (Dart 3.12)
- The toolchain for your target platform: Android SDK, Xcode, or Visual Studio with the "Desktop development with C++" workload
- Linux only (Debian/Ubuntu package names): `clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libkeybinder-3.0-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev`
- iOS only: `brew install meson ninja llvm lld`. The Xcode build compiles the iSH sandbox and prepares the Alpine Linux image automatically.
- Android only: `python3`, `curl` and `tar`. The Gradle build downloads the PRoot binaries automatically.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/legsegue-gif/canary_alpha.git
cd canary_alpha
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Several packages are vendored under [`dependencies/`](dependencies) and referenced by path, so no extra setup is needed for them.
